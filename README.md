# React Boilerplate CRA Template Examples & Tutorials

## Under development. Come back a bit later :)

![](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/cra-template-examples/workflows/examples/badge.svg)

This repository contains example **scenarios** and **implementations** for **`commonly used`** and needed web application patterns. All the examples are built on top the [react-boilerplate-cra-template]. The goal is to to guide the users and provide samples on how to implement basic stuff that is frequently needed when creating a web application

### List of current examples:

## Getting Started

All the example applications are isolated into seperate folders, so go into your example folder and follow the instructions there (if there are any). All of them are built on top of the [react-boilerplate-cra-template], meaning that they are all a simple web application.

All the examples are **community provided** and does **NOT** guarantee or promise anything. They are basically showing you how to do stuff and giving you some ideas. They might be outdated in time.

## Do you want to contribute with another example?

Thats super cool. Always appreciated. Here are steps you can do for your pull requests:

**1 -** Please ask first by `opening an issue` if that can qualify as an example before doing all the work. We don't wanna waste your time.

**2 -** Fork this repo and create your example folder by specifying a name

```sh
npm run create [YOUR_NAME_FOR_THIS_EXAMPLE_FOLDER]
```

**3 -** Now make your changes inside the created folder. Make sure it's self-sufficient app. It is initialized with the [react-boilerplate-cra-template]. At this point you must be familiar with it if you are already not.

**4 -** When you are done, make sure everything passes the simple checks by running

```sh
npm run check-examples
```

**5 -** Update your `README.md` for everyone checking your example application. Tell them what that is and give some details etc...

**6 -** Finally add your self and your folder to the [CODEOWNERS](/.github/CODEOWNERS) file as described there. This will require your review if there is another pull request updating your folder. Optionally, you can add your self to [.all-contributorsrc](.all-contributorsrc) to have your name displayed in the contributors section below (you have generate again from the [cli](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/cli/overview))

**7 -** You are now ready for a pull request ü•≥
